# Project Description

The goal of this project is to develop an API server that automates various tasks at work. The server should be secure, easily deployable to different servers, and customizable for different use cases. It should also be scalable and modular to accommodate future expansion.

## Use Cases

- Web automation using tools like Selenium
  
- Interacting with other APIs
- Reading and updating shared Microsoft OneDrive files
- Creating a web interface for form filling and button actions

## Technologies

- Python: Flask or Django for the API server
- HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (with frameworks like React or Vue.js) for the web interface
- Microsoft Graph API for interacting with OneDrive
- Docker for containerization and easy deployment
- SvelteKit for building the front-end

## Architecture

- Design the application in a modular fashion to promote reusability
- Use separate modules or services for different functionalities
- Ensure security and compliance with proper authentication mechanisms
- Integrate Docker for containerization and version control
- Incorporate SvelteKit for the front-end development

## Deployment

- Use Docker to containerize the API server and the SvelteKit front-end
- Utilize Docker Compose to manage multi-container applications
- Consider setting up a CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment
